# Hi, I'm Lucas Couto 👋

**QA Engineer** with a passion for building reliable software and improving how teams test.

I'm a curious, detail-driven professional who genuinely cares about quality. With a background in **Logistics**, I bring a unique perspective on business logic and mission-critical processes—which helps me design better test strategies and catch edge cases others might miss.

Currently at **Invent Software**, I work with **WebDriverIO**, **Playwright**, and **Cypress** to automate ERP/SAP applications, while also building internal tools to monitor RPA operations and streamline testing workflows.

### Overview
A web-based orchestration platform that manages and triggers automation workflows through an internal RPA system. Built with Firebase and Google Authentication, it provides a centralized interface for scheduling, monitoring, and tracking RPA executions across the organization.

### How It Works
Users authenticate via **Google Sign-In** to access their automation dashboard. The platform acts as an **orchestration layer** that communicates with the company's internal RPA system through API calls:

1. **Script Management**: Users organize automation workflows into logical groups within the platform
2. **Execution Triggering**: When a script is scheduled or manually triggered, the platform sends API requests to the internal RPA system
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: The platform tracks execution status by polling the RPA system's APIs

All configuration data is stored securely in **Firebase Firestore**, with authentication handled through **Firebase Authentication** using Google OAuth. The platform serves as a user-friendly interface to manage and monitor the internal RPA infrastructure without direct script execution.

### Key Features
- **Google Authentication**: Secure, passwordless login using Google accounts
- **Script Organization**: Group related automation scripts for better management
- **Execution Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of script runs with status tracking
- **Execution History**: Complete audit trail with detailed logs.
- **Cloud-Based**: Accessible from anywhere with automatic data synchronization

### Impact & Results
- **80% Time Savings**: Reduced manual task execution time for repetitive processes
- **Error Elimination**: Standardized execution removes human error from routine tasks

### Technology Stack
Node.js • Express.js • Firebase Firestore • Firebase Authentication • Google Cloud Functions

## 🧠 How I Approach Quality

**AI-First Mindset**  
I'm an AI enthusiast who uses AI tools daily to improve productivity and problem-solving:
- Using AI to generate case test data.
- Using AI to analyze automated tests logs.
- Using AI to generate test code.
- Using AI to learn and solve techinical problems.


**Continuous Learning**  
I'm always looking to improve. Right now, I'm focused on:
- Mastering **Java** for API testing
- Learning best practices around Agile development and test strategy


**Collaboration & Communication**  
My logistics background taught me the importance of clear communication and understanding business needs—skills I bring to every QA role.
